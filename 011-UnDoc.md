# 🧠 UnDoc — Hackathon Idea Memo

**Tagline:** *Undo the docs. Read what matters.*
**One-liner:** Paste any documentation URL → get a clear, Divio-structured, Tailwind-styled page that’s readable, versioned, and community-voted.

**Elevator Pitch:**
UnDoc is your developer’s secret weapon for understanding complex documentation fast. Instead of drowning in walls of enterprise jargon, just paste a link — and UnDoc transforms it into a structured, readable, and actionable page. It’s like having an expert technical writer who instantly rewrites any doc into the style you wish every API team used.

## 🚀 Overview

UnDoc is an MVP service that regenerates complex, enterprise-style technical documentation (from Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Stripe, Twilio, etc.) into easy-to-understand, developer-first pages.

It uses the **Divio Documentation System** — Tutorials · How-to · Explanation · Reference — to structure and present content in a clear, human-friendly way.

### Problem

* Big-tech documentation is *technically accurate* but often **hard to digest**.
* They assume enterprise experience, use internal jargon, and bury the “why” under too much “how.”
* Developers waste hours understanding concepts that could be explained in minutes.

### Solution

UnDoc converts dense vendor docs into simplified, visually consistent pages:

* Divio-structured layout (Tutorials, How-to, Explanation, Reference)
* Tailwind-styled, modern UI
* Versions generated by different prompts or LLMs
* Voting system to surface the best versions
* Citations and freshness indicators to maintain trust

### Value Propositions

* **Save developer time** — instantly clarify complex documentation into actionable insights.
* **Reduce onboarding friction** — help new engineers learn cloud and API systems faster.
* **Improve technical literacy** — democratize access to advanced tech concepts for all levels.
* **Boost productivity** — integrate directly into dev flows as a doc translator tool.
* **Empower communities** — encourage open collaboration through voting and community curation.
* **Bridge AI and learning** — leverage generative models to make understanding faster, not just searching.

## 🧠 Insights from the Discussion

### Why Documentation Feels Hard

1. **Optimized for coverage, not clarity.**
   Docs teams focus on completeness and accuracy — not teaching.
2. **Internal vocabulary leaks out.**
   Many terms come from internal architecture, not user mental models.
3. **Fear of simplification.**
   Enterprises avoid analogies to prevent misinterpretation.

### Opportunity

Developers don’t want AI chatbots that summarize docs; they want **better docs themselves.**
UnDoc fills that gap — an AI-powered *translation layer* that transforms enterprise-speak into developer-speak.

---

## 🧩 The BetterDocs Framework (underlying method)

1. **Identify Confusions:** Overload, jargon, missing “why.”
2. **Apply Divio Quadrants:** Tutorials · How-to · Explanation · Reference.
3. **Simplify Language:** Write for a senior dev who’s new to the product.
4. **Use Callouts:** Clarify terms like “tokens vs credentials.”
5. **Show Defaults:** Always highlight best practice first.

This framework powers UnDoc’s regeneration logic and could evolve into a standalone toolkit or API.

## 🧪 Hackathon Deliverable (MVP)

**Repository:** `redoc-mvp`
**Deploy:** Vercel (Next.js preset)
