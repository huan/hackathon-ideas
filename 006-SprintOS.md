# Project Code Name: **SprintOS**

## 🟢 One-Liner

**SprintOS** — The AI-powered copilot that runs your Foundation Sprint in 2 days and Google Design Sprint in 5 days, turning chaos into clarity and prototypes into evidence-backed decisions.

## 🎤 30-Second Elevator Pitch

Too many teams waste months debating strategy, building the wrong features, or failing to align around their true customer. Google’s Design Sprint method has proven itself as a powerful 5-day process to validate ideas quickly, but most teams struggle at the very beginning — defining the right goal, the right customer, and the right differentiation. That’s where **SprintOS** comes in: an AI facilitator trained on the Sprint methodology that guides your team step-by-step, synthesizes inputs in real-time, and helps you produce investor-ready clarity in a week. Faster, sharper, and more consistent than human-only facilitation.

## 🧭 Background

* **Creator:** Huan Li — Google Developer Expert, Google Design Sprint Master, facilitator of 20+ startup funding teams.
* **Problem Identified:** In almost every Design Sprint I ran, teams got lost at the start — struggling to define ultimate goals, customer personas, and positioning.
* **Observation:** Facilitation is mostly procedural. A “robot facilitator” could handle timeboxing, agendas, and guiding steps. But AI can go further — adapting, summarizing, and enhancing.
* **Opportunity:** AI era enables *super-facilitators* that improve sprint quality, consistency, and scalability.

## 📚 What is a Design Sprint?

### Foundation Sprint (2 days)

* Created by Jake Knapp & John Zeratsky in *Click* (2025).
* **Day 1:** Define customer, problem, and differentiation. Draft Mini-Manifesto.
* **Day 2:** Explore solutions, evaluate with Magic Lenses, decide Top Bet, craft Founding Hypothesis.
* Output: **Founding Hypothesis** — the strategic core that guides product direction.

### Google Design Sprint (5 days)

* Originated at Google, popularized in *Sprint* (2016).
* **Day 1:** Understand & Map.
* **Day 2:** Sketch solutions.
* **Day 3:** Decide & Storyboard.
* **Day 4:** Build prototype.
* **Day 5:** Test with real users.
* Output: **Prototype + User Insights** — direct evidence of product-market potential.

## 🚀 Why Hack on This?

1. **Massive Pain Point**: Teams fail early because they can’t align on goals/customers.
2. **Proven Process**: Design Sprint is a globally trusted methodology (Google, GV, startups, corporates).
3. **AI Leverage**: AI can facilitate, synthesize, and accelerate beyond human capacity.
4. **Founder Credibility**: As a GDE and Sprint Master, I bring expertise, case studies, and credibility.
5. **Hackathon Fit**: Demo-ready in days. We can build a working prototype of the AI Sprint Copilot.

## 💡 Vision for SprintOS

* **AI Orchestrator**: Guides agenda, timing, and exercises.
* **Synthesizer Agent**: Auto-clusters notes, drafts Mini-Manifesto, builds 2×2 charts.
* **Persona Agent**: Role-plays customer interviews.
* **Prototype Agent**: Generates Figma scaffolds and assets.
* **Output**: Clean Sprint Brief + investor deck.

## 🛠️ Hackathon Deliverables

* **Landing Page MVP**: Already drafted using Flowbite Marketing UI.
* **AI Sprint Copilot Demo**: Core workflow showing timeboxing + clustering + hypothesis builder.
* **Storytelling Deck**: Use SprintOS as a category-defining idea.
* **Live Demo Scenario**: "Run a 15-min mini sprint with AI Copilot."

## 🌟 Why Join Me?

* Work with a seasoned facilitator who knows the Sprint inside-out.
* Opportunity to co-build a tool that democratizes expert facilitation.
* Be part of an early category-defining product (AI x Design Thinking).
* Potential beyond the hackathon: real market, real need, real growth.

---

## 📍 Next Steps

* Form hackathon team (engineering, design, AI/ML).
* Build lightweight Copilot prototype with agenda + synthesis.
* Integrate with Miro/Figma for demo.
* Polish landing page + deck.
* Deliver live demo that *feels magical*.
