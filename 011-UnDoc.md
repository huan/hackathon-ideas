# 🧠 UnDoc — Hackathon Idea Memo

**Tagline:** *Turn dense vendor docs into developer-ready guides.*
**One-liner:** Paste any documentation URL → get a clear, Divio-structured, Tailwind-styled page that’s readable, versioned, and community-voted.

**Elevator Pitch:**
ReDoc is your developer’s secret weapon for understanding complex documentation fast. Instead of drowning in walls of enterprise jargon, just paste a link — and ReDoc transforms it into a structured, readable, and actionable page. It’s like having an expert technical writer who instantly rewrites any doc into the style you wish every API team used.

## 🚀 Overview

ReDoc is an MVP service that regenerates complex, enterprise-style technical documentation (from Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Stripe, Twilio, etc.) into easy-to-understand, developer-first pages.

It uses the **Divio Documentation System** — Tutorials · How-to · Explanation · Reference — to structure and present content in a clear, human-friendly way.

### Problem

* Big-tech documentation is *technically accurate* but often **hard to digest**.
* They assume enterprise experience, use internal jargon, and bury the “why” under too much “how.”
* Developers waste hours understanding concepts that could be explained in minutes.

### Solution

ReDoc converts dense vendor docs into simplified, visually consistent pages:

* Divio-structured layout (Tutorials, How-to, Explanation, Reference)
* Tailwind-styled, modern UI
* Versions generated by different prompts or LLMs
* Voting system to surface the best versions
* Citations and freshness indicators to maintain trust

### Value Propositions

* **Save developer time** — instantly clarify complex documentation into actionable insights.
* **Reduce onboarding friction** — help new engineers learn cloud and API systems faster.
* **Improve technical literacy** — democratize access to advanced tech concepts for all levels.
* **Boost productivity** — integrate directly into dev flows as a doc translator tool.
* **Empower communities** — encourage open collaboration through voting and community curation.
* **Bridge AI and learning** — leverage generative models to make understanding faster, not just searching.

   * Fetch HTML via serverless function.
   * Extract key content using `cheerio` and sanitize.

2. **Heuristic Divio generator**

   * No LLM required (initial MVP).
   * Split content into Tutorials, How-to, Explanation, Reference, and Common Confusions.

3. **Preview page**

   * Beautiful Tailwind layout.
   * Export as single HTML file for offline sharing.

4. **Deployable instantly on Vercel**

   * Zero config.
   * No database, no authentication.
   * Uses only Next.js + Tailwind.

## 🧱 System Design (MVP)

**Stack:**  Next.js (App Router) · Tailwind CSS · Vercel Serverless Functions · Cheerio · TypeScript

### MVP Architecture Flow

```
User → [Next.js UI] → /api/generate → fetch URL → extract content → generate Divio JSON → render Tailwind page → Export HTML
```

### File Highlights

* `/app/page.tsx` — Landing page + form.
* `/app/api/generate/route.ts` — Fetch & extract.
* `/components/DivioView.tsx` — Render structured content.
* `/lib/extract.ts` — HTML extraction via cheerio.
* `/lib/text.ts` — Text truncation utility.

### API Response Structure

```json
{
  "title": "Google Cloud Authentication",
  "description": "Overview of authentication methods.",
  "divio": {
    "tutorials": [ ... ],
    "howto": [ ... ],
    "explanation": { ... },
    "reference": { ... },
    "confusions": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Insights from the Discussion

### Why Documentation Feels Hard

1. **Optimized for coverage, not clarity.**
   Docs teams focus on completeness and accuracy — not teaching.
2. **Internal vocabulary leaks out.**
   Many terms come from internal architecture, not user mental models.
3. **Fear of simplification.**
   Enterprises avoid analogies to prevent misinterpretation.

### Opportunity

Developers don’t want AI chatbots that summarize docs; they want **better docs themselves.**
ReDoc fills that gap — an AI-powered *translation layer* that transforms enterprise-speak into developer-speak.

## 🧩 The BetterDocs Framework (underlying method)

1. **Identify Confusions:** Overload, jargon, missing “why.”
2. **Apply Divio Quadrants:** Tutorials · How-to · Explanation · Reference.
3. **Simplify Language:** Write for a senior dev who’s new to the product.
4. **Use Callouts:** Clarify terms like “tokens vs credentials.”
5. **Show Defaults:** Always highlight best practice first.

This framework powers ReDoc’s regeneration logic and could evolve into a standalone toolkit or API.

## 🧪 Hackathon Deliverable (MVP)

**Repository:** `redoc-mvp`
**Deploy:** Vercel (Next.js preset)

**Key goals:**

* Works locally and deploys instantly.
* Requires no environment variables.
* MVP achieves functional flow (URL → extract → Divio JSON → HTML render).

**File:** [`redoc-mvp.zip`](sandbox:/mnt/data/redoc-mvp.zip)
