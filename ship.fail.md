# 🚀 Ship.Fail — GitHub for Hackathon Ideas

## History

- Aug 28, 2025 - [Luke Hollis: did it! ✊🏻](https://github.com/lukehollis/shipfail)

## 🔥 One-liner

A tiny hacker-friendly service where developers can **draft, share, fork, and team up on hackathon ideas** — fail fast, ship faster.

---

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30s)

Hackathons are where bold, crazy ideas come alive — but too often, they vanish after the event. **Ship.Fail** is a lightweight community hub for hackers to **collect their half-baked ideas**, make them public, and let others join in. Think of it as **GitHub for hackathon ideas**: draft privately, publish to attract collaborators, fork ideas, and form teams before hackathons even start. Simple, fun, and community-powered — just like the hacker spirit.

## 💡 Original Idea (from my head)

> "I think it could be a hackathon idea collection portal: any ideas can be registered, and have a brief idea explanation there, for personal record first.
>
> Then, user can choose to make the ideas be public seen, to attract other people to join, especially before some hackathon, it can be used to form the team.
>
> At last, interested users can join the idea very simple by click some button called 'interested'. All users need to register via GitHub account so they can learn from each other what they have been done before. LinkedIn is optional but recommended.
>
> If we implemented this, it will be like an GitHub for hackathon ideas, haha. People maybe can fork an idea to became themselves, or send improvement suggestion to existing ideas.
>
> I feel ship.fail can focus on the most tiny but most important part of the hackathon ideas - keep the service focused.
>
> Actually, if ship.fail are in service, I’d love to register my first two hackathon ideas on it: [https://github.com/huan/hackathon-ideas](https://github.com/huan/hackathon-ideas)"
